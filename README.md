#  Rust Chess Engine


A simple chess engine written in Rust, implementing a Negamax search algorithm.  
Currently supports move generation and evaluation, with a basic Negamax search. Alpha-beta pruning and more are planned for future improvements.

### Build and Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/M4rcinWisniewski/RustChessEngine
cd RustChessEngine
# Build the project
cargo build --release

# Run the engine
cargo run

# Run the engine with a custom FEN position
cargo run -- --fen "{your_fen_string}"
```
## 📄 Example
### Example of the engine choosing a move in a sample position:
